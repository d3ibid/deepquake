					Arvei User Guide

0. (only for OXS users) Configure OSX's SSH client:

	- Preferences/Advanced disable set locale on startup
	- https://wiki.rc.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/FAQ#Unable_to_run_job:_JSV_stderr:_perl:_warning:_Setting_locale_failed.

1. Enter the gateway (replace 'rtous' with your username)

	ssh rtous@gw.ac.upc.edu 

2. Enter an interactive execution node 

	qrsh 

3. Move to your scratch zone (use the proper path for your user)

	cd /scratch/nas/4/rtous

4. Create and activate a Python virtualenv

	virtualenv deepquake_virtualenv
	source deepquake_virtualenv/bin/activate

5. Download and enter the repository
 
	git clone https://github.com/rtous/deepquake.git
	cd deepquake

6. Install the dependencies (can take around 30 mins.)

	xargs -L 1 pip install < requirements.txt 

7. Prepare the submission script

Let's use the example one within arvei/example_experiment_arvei.sh.

8. Try a local version of the script first (to detect premature errors)

	./test.sh

Abort the execution if everything seems to be ok.

9. Submit a "special" version of the script to tue queue

NOTE: Ensure that the virtualenv activated within the script is the correct one (deepquake_virtualenv).

	qsub -S /bin/bash ./arvei/test_arvei.sh

Once finished, it should have created an output directory within /scratch/nas/4/rtous/deepquake with the results.

10. Debugging

In order to check the stdout/stderr output:

	#Check in which node the job is executing)
	qstat -u rtous

	#Enter the node in which the job is executing to see the error logs
	qrsh -l h='arvei-145' (el node que ens dona qstat)

NOTE: You would not be able to access the node if the node is too busy (which is ok as means your job is still running and has not crashed).
